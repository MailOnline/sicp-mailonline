;; Exercise 1.33
;; You can obtain an even more general version of accumulate (exercise 1.32) by
;; introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined.  That is,
;; combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a
;; specified condition.  The resulting filtered-accumulate abstraction takes
;; the same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of
;; one argument that specifies the filter.  Write filtered-accumulate as a
;; procedure.  Show how to express the following using filtered-accumulate:
;;
;; a.  the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a to b
;;     (assuming that you have a prime? predicate already written)
;; b.  the product of all the positive integers less than n that are
;;     relatively prime to n (i.e. all positive integers i < n such that
;;     GCD(i,n) = 1).
