;; Exercise 3.7
;; Consider the bank account objects created by make-account, with the password
;; modification described in exercise 3.3.  Suppose that our banking system
;; requires the ability to make joint accounts.  Define a procedure make-joint
;; that accomplishes this.  Make-joint should take three arguments.  The first
;; is a password-protected account.  The second argument must match the password
;; with which the account was defined in order for the make-joint operation to
;; proceed.  The third argument is a new password.  Make-joint is to create an
;; additional access to the original account using the new password.  For
;; example, if peter-acc is a bank account with password open-sesame, then
;;
;; (define paul-acc
;;   (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))
;;
;; will allow one to make transactions on peter-acc using the name paul-acc and
;; the password rosebud.  You may wish to modify your solution to exercise 3.3
;; to accommodate this new feature.
