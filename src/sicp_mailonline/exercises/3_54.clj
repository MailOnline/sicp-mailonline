;; Exercise 3.54
;; Define a procedure mul-streams, analogous to add-streams, that produces the
;; elementwise product of its two input streams.  Use this together with the
;; stream of integers to complete the following definition of the stream whose
;; nth element (counting from 0) is n+1 factorial:
;;
;; (define factorials (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams <??> <??>)))
