;; Exercise 1.7
;; The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be
;; very effective for finding the square root of very small numbers.
;; Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always
;; performed with limited precision.  This makes our test inadequate
;; for very large numbers.  
;; Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails
;; for small and large numbers.
;;
;; An alternative strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch
;; how guess changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when
;; the change is a very small fraction of the guess.  
;; Design a square root procedure that uses this kind of test.  
;; Does this work better for small and large numbers?

;; ==================================================================
;; For very small numbers, a fixed tolerance of 0.001 can represent a
;; significant error in proportional terms:
;;   (sqrt 0.001) => 0.0412
;;   (square 0.0412) => 0.001697
;;   error = (- 0.001697 0.001) = 0.000697
;; This error looks small in absolute terms, but results in an answer
;; that is 30% higher than expected.
;; 
;; For very large numbers, the imprecision of a floating point 
;; representation can result in the fixed tolerance solution
;; failing to converge on a good-enough guess, and hence an
;; infinite loop.  For example, it may not be possible to represent
;; the result of improve precisely enough for it to ever satisfy
;; close-enough?  Without tail-call optimisation, this results
;; in a stack overflow error.
;;
;; Yes, the stabilising proportional change approach does work better
;; for small and large numbers.
